# Retrospective

## What was not clear, where did we get stuck?

We didnâ€™t follow through the planning as we added more stuff on our own

There is still miscommunication about who does what at the beginning: who does
what

Organization from the beginning: which folder or files to put the code

Class ID sometimes overlapped

Technical parts:

- HTML: need to put certain code at CERTAIN place (position)

  - Logo: to create a class for logo, right now the logo is just a normal html
    code

## What was clear, what did we master or improve?

- Github workflow was much better
- Adding the md files
- Communication was better Basics of HTML: classes and property (and how to
  diversify them)
- Reviewing pull request is better now
- Resolving conflicts and recognizing problems
- Git stash: save your local changes
- git stash pop: to apply the local changes to update the local repo, to use
  when forgetting to git pull origin
- Git pull origin main can be used on local branch

## Where can we still use some help?

- CSS flexbox
- External styling with CSS
- How we should organize CSS files for the same page or for the different pages
- How to write and diversify classes in CSS

## Where can we help others moving forwards?

- Canva or Vistacreate to make logo
- CSS color generator
- How to install Font Icon, Fontello: download your package and install into
  your VS Code
- Fls.guru to generate background outlook
